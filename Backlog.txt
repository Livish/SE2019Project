Sprint1
=======================================================================
*Story 1. Simulate a particular day's data rates.
Rate = message number / second.

Tasks (1)  Download FeedRate.csv file from marketdatapeaks.net:
(2)Create CsvReader class to read data
(3)Store data.

*Story 2. Know average message latency and throughput.
Average Throughput = Average Rate
Average Rate = (Throughput += per second FeedRates) / FeedRates number
Latency= (Per second Message count / Average Throughput or per second rate ) - 1
Average Latency = (Total Latency += Latency) / Time
  
Tasks (1) Calculate average throughput.
(2)Set per second message count
(3)Calculate Latency and store them
(4)Calculate average latency
(5)Display average throughtput and average latency

*Story 3. Monolithic design in simulation
Tasks (1) Set input buffer and processing unit - This task is related with Story 2 tasks. 

Sprint2
=======================================================================
Story 4. Make sure simulation results are correct
Tasks (1) Create test class

Story 5. Use more realistic input date rate model
Tasks (1) Set per microsecond input message count
(2)Calculate microsecond rates
(3)Calculate latency


Story 6. Know the distribution of latency as 50th, 75th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles.
Task (1) Calculate distribution 
(2)Show distribution.

Sprint 3
========================================================================
Story 7. Task parallel design.

Tasks (1). design parallel modle
Ratas = Rates * P

Story 8. Provide per - microsecond data rates to the simulation.
Tasks (1). Set microsecnod rates
(2). Reader microsecond rates file.
(3). Display result.

Story 9. See system level test cases.
Tasks (1). Set test data: processors, rate, message
(2). Manual calculate
(3). Compare with story 8 result.
